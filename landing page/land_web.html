        <div class="col-sm-4" font_style="">A venue marketing strategy is more than a plan, it’s the GPS system that helps you arrive at a predetermined destination.
            It’s the tool you use to tell if you’re on the appropriate trajectory and to correct your course when you take
            an unexpected wrong turn.</div>
        <div class="col-sm-4" font_style="">Your venue marketing strategy is a vital component to the successful implementation of any venue marketing tactic
            and essential to the scaled growth of your business.</div>
        <div class="col-sm-4" font_style="">However, implementing venue marketing tactics without a proper strategy in place is like driving blind. You have
            an idea of where you’re going but you have no idea of how you’re going to get there, and it’s nearly impossible
            to tell whether or not you’re heading in the right direction.</div>
